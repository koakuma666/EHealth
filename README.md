# EHealth

Use MATLAB to extract and process ECG data.

Aims: Read the first 11 second data and show in one window. Use band pass filter to process the window and get the HR. Then refresh the data every second, and move the waveform of the window to the left by one second of data. Finally calculate the heart rate within one minute.

Notice: Remove the first second data, because of filtering boundary effect.

Example of the Result:
